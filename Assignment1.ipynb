    "   integers:This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or        decimal).\n",
    "   float:This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation\n",
    "   complex Numbers:Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example – 2+3j\n",
    "   2.sequence data type:\n",
    "   -->list:\n",
    "   Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.\n",
    "   -->String:\n",
    "   In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.\n",
    "   -->Tuple:\n",
    "   In Python, tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping of the data sequence. Tuples can contain any number of elements and of any datatype (like strings, integers, list, etc.).\n",
